Number guessing game homework. 

_This assignment was completed as part of my coursework at The Iron Yard._

###Assignment
It's like playing hot and cold with number guessing!

**Description**

Create a Python program that picks a number at random which you must guess within 5 chances.

**Objectives**

Understand the basics of loops, conditional statements, and functions in the Python programing language.

**Normal Mode**

Create a program that will choose a number (it can be random if you like) and will ask you to pick the same number.

**Rules**

- If the number you pick is lower than the computer's number - it needs to tell you that your guess was too low.
- If the number you pick is higher than the computer's number - it needs to tell you that your guess was too high.
- If you pick the same number as the computer, the game is over.
- The program must output the number of turns you took.
- (optional) Tell the user if they are close.

**Hard Mode**

- Complete all requirements of Normal Mode.
- Create a version of the game that asks you to pick the number. The computer then takes guesses at what the number is.
- All of the same rules as the Normal Mode apply to the computer.

**Very Hard Mode**

- Complete all requirements of Hard Mode, optimize the computer's strategy so it improves it's performance and guesses in fewer turns.
